# GE-MDS-FNM-V2
GE MDS Field Network Manager V2

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Deployments
To deploy our webapp we use a service called ZEIT Now.
It is setup to automatically deploy every commit. You can see those deployments
here: https://github.com/GE-MDS-FNM-V2/GE-MDS-FNM-V2/deployments.

Now's integration also posts a comment on every commit it publishes. You can
find an example of this here: 
https://github.com/GE-MDS-FNM-V2/GE-MDS-FNM-V2/commit/d2ec6d0fe11941ce52c60a14673764692cbda863#comments

If you would like to deploy from your own commandline rather than through the
git hooks, you can use ZEIT's CLI tool to do that. The following should get you
started with that:
```
yarn add now
now
```
(Note: the now CLI tool requires you to login, however the CLI will instruct you
on how to do that yourself)

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `yarn start`

Runs the app in the development mode.<br />
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.<br />
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `yarn test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.<br />
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `yarn build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.<br />
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.<br />
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `yarn eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can’t go back!**

If you aren’t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (Webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you’re on your own.

You don’t have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn’t feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn’t be useful if you couldn’t customize it when you are ready for it.

# Project Synosis
GE Industrial Communications (INDC) is a department of General Electric that creates hardened wireless (MDS products) and optical data products that are sold to customers that need to operate networks in harsh environments, such as electric utility companies and oil and gas companies. These wireless products include radios that can extend network connectivity up to around 30 kilometers. In order to manage these networks of radios, customers need to have applications for configuring and managing their radio devices. This type of application is called a Network Management System (NMS). 

GE’s Field Network Manager (FNM) is a free NMS that GE created for customers with smaller fleets of radios who do not need to purchase the enterprise NMS platform. The problem is that the current FNM is built with legacy technologies which are losing support.

This project is the first phase in building a new FNM using the latest lightweight, web-based technologies. By modernizing the application to newer technologies the application will be easier to maintain. This will also allow for the application to be given the updated GE user experience. Our goal for this project is to build an open source web-based desktop application that will allow users to connect and configure GE’s latest MDS radio over serial or ethernet ports, using the protocols of the particular radio. Additionally, this application should be able to scale to connect to any GE MDS radio product using any of the radios’ protocols and connect through serial, ethernet, or remote network connections.
